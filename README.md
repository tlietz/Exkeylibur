# Exkeylibur

```markdown
I froze your switches and made Exkeylibur,
and pushed it onto Github forever.
It stays there like Excalibur,
Are you its Arthur?
Say you are.

Take the cool, dark, steeled board,
Steal it, sheath it, in your workflow.
I would drown my other keebs to be together.
Must they breathe? 'Cause typing feels like heaven.
```
