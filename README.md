# Exkeylibur

```markdown
I froze your switches and made Exkeylibur,
and pushed it onto Github forever.
It stays there like Excalibur,
Are you its Arthur?
Say you are.

Take the cool, dark, steeled board,
Steal it, sheath it, in your workflow.
I would drown with it to be together.
Must you breathe? 'Cause it will feel like heaven.
```
