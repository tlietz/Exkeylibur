# Exkeylibur

```markdown
I froze your switches and made Exkeylibur,
and pushed it onto Github forever.
It stays there like Excalibur,
Are you its Arthur?
Say you are.

Take the cool, dark, steeled board,
Steal it, sheath it, in your workflow.
All would drown their other keebs to be together.
Must they breathe? 'Cause typing feels like heaven.
```

I would like to thank the honorable [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep), for without you, the Exkeylibur would have no pcb layout.

## Prelude

An Exkeylibur is a 36-key, diodeless, wireless-only keyboard with Ferris stagger and a reversible PCB.

An Exkeylibur can be wielded without a sheath, however, you are encouraged to create one.

A promicro, or any other non-wireless microcontroller drop-in for the promicro, is **not** supported. This is because the GPIO pin that would normally go to a TRRS jack
now goes to an extra switch.

As of right now, all Exkeylibur are choc-spaced.

## Firmware

Wield the Exkeylibur with the [firmware](https://github.com/tlietz/zmk-config)

## Todo For version 2

- [ ] Rotate thumb keys by 90 degrees to support 1.5u keycaps
- [ ] Add room to have better places to put rubber feet
- [ ] Move home thumb row key to be between the original inner and outer thumb key placement of the Ferris
- [ ] Place reset button in a place that can be easily pressed by hand
- [ ] Add drill holes to support Corne MCU covers
